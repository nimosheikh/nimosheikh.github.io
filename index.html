            <p><h7> My name is Nimo Sheikh, IT student at RMIT University.
             Wife and Mother, I work at a company as data personal. I'm originally from Africa I can speak three different languages, I moved from Africa with my family to Australia at a very young age.

my family lived in Perth (West Australia )then we moved to Melbourne twenty years ago.</br></p>

<br> <p>I studied computer course at RMIT TAFE and that was the birth of my love for IT, then I applied for A degree in Computer Science at Victoria University. while I was in my second year I met my husband and we got married. as a young couple we needed money so we both had to work, then I put my studies on hold, and now ten years have passed I came back to studies.</br></p>

<br>I'm not a morning person and I always get my work in the mornings. I'm a shy person, but very outspoken, especially when I believe in something. not a big fan of arguments or long pointless conversations.
I love music all types of music, but my passion for piano is beyond, only piano clams me down the most stressful life moments
.</br>

<br>I love night stars sometimes I sit outside only to watch the stars, I believe they are the most beautiful thing I ever. 
LOVE f1 (Formula one) especially Lewis Hamilton as I know about his life story he is such great inspiration for me, to never give up on what you love and work hard to achieve it then who does love fast cars. I have a big family all around world brother and sisters. doing this course I feel I found my identity I hope to reach my dream to be a successful Web developer.</p></h4></br>
