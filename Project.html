               My Project is to design a website dedicated to multicultural women and children’s educational programs and services. 
   non-profit multicultural organisation that is focused on providing essential services to culturally diverse women and children.<br>
                
                 unfortunate prevalence of issues relating to domestic violence, illiteracy, physical and mental health,
                much of which is amplified by the fact that many women in such conditions are unable to access required 
                information and facilities. Belonging to such communities, our volunteers have been able to identify and 
                relate to the various reasons as to why numerous culturally diverse women are not gaining access to available
                facilities.<br> 
                
                
                
          Cultural barriers such as attitudes that condemn women speaking out about their personal issues, tend to 
                be amongst the utmost influencing 
                factors that prevent women from seeking help. Language barriers, fear of stigmatisation or exposure, along with
                cultural and religious conformities can also significantly prevent women from reaching out.<br>
                
                
                I believe that the lack of information and guidance available to women in such communities has not only prevented them from seeking support but also prevented them from realising the serious consequences that may have a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of themselves and their children.
Realising the various apprehensions and barriers that are preventing women from seeking support,
                I endeavour to develop a website dedicated to countering these impediments, providing a safe,
                anonymous and trustworthy environment that allows women and children to comfortably gain direct access 
                to essential facilities. <br>
                The website will cover all aspects relating to the wellbeing of women and children, 
                incorporating with the English language access to information in the Arabic and Somali languages for non-English 
                  speakers.
