RE: Community Funding
We are writing to apply for the council of Banyule Support on our endeavours to establish a website dedicated to multicultural women and children’s educational programs and services. 
We are a not-for-profit multicultural organisation that is focused on providing essential services to culturally diverse women and children, particularly non-English speaking migrant groups such as Somalian and Arabic speakers. In our years of engagement with various immigrant communities within Melbourne, we have observed an unfortunate prevalence of issues relating to domestic violence, illiteracy, physical and mental health, much of which is amplified by the fact that many women in such conditions are unable to access required information and facilities. Belonging to such communities, our volunteers have been able to identify and relate to the various reasons as to why numerous culturally diverse women are not gaining access to available facilities. Cultural barriers such as attitudes that condemn women speaking out about their personal issues, tend to be amongst the utmost influencing factors that prevent women from seeking help. Language barriers, fear of stigmatisation or exposure, along with cultural and religious conformities can also significantly prevent women from reaching out.
Whilst there are currently no official figures to indicate the prevalence of domestic violence in such culturally isolated communities, we have found from our experiences within Somalian communities that an average of 1 in every 8 households has a woman experiencing some form of abuse. We believe that the lack of information and guidance available to women in such communities has not only prevented them from seeking support but also prevented them from realising the serious consequences that may have a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of themselves and their children.
Realising the various apprehensions and barriers that are preventing culturally diverse women from seeking support, we endeavour to develop a website dedicated to countering these impediments, providing a safe, anonymous and trustworthy environment that allows women and children to comfortably gain direct access to essential facilities. Our website will cover all aspects relating to the wellbeing of women and children, incorporating with the English language access to information in the Arabic and Somali languages for non-English speakers.
