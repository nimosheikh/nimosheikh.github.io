                 <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
                <h5> Project Detailed description</h5>
<h7> My project is to establish a website dedicated to multicultural women and children’s educational programs and services. 
a non-for-profit multicultural organisation that is focused on providing essential services to culturally diverse women and children, p


My years of engagement with various communities within Melbourne, I have observed an unfortunate prevalence of issues relating to domestic violence, illiteracy, physical and mental health, much of which is amplified by the fact that many women in such conditions are unable to access required information and facilities.


Belonging to such communities, I have been able to identify and relate to the various reasons as to why numerous culturally diverse women are not gaining access to available facilities.

                </h7><h5> My project Motivation</h5>

<h7>Cultural barriers such as attitudes that condemn women speaking out about their personal issues, tend to be amongst the utmost influencing factors that prevent women from seeking help. Language barriers, fear of stigmatisation or exposure, along with cultural and religious conformities can also significantly prevent women from reaching out.<br>

Whilst there are currently no official figures to indicate the prevalence of domestic violence in such culturally isolated communities, They have found from social experiences within some communities that an average of 1 in every 18 households has a woman experiencing some form of abuse.</br> 

We believe that the lack of information and guidance available to women in such communities has not only prevented them from seeking support but also prevented them from realising the serious consequences that may have a detrimental effect on the wellbeing of themselves and their children.

Realising the various apprehensions and barriers that are preventing culturally diverse women from seeking support</h7>.</br><P>




<h5> project Tools and Technologies</h5><h7>
 we will need to buy hosting and domain name for the site, then we will host the site in PHP platform and we prefer the database to  MySQL to store large data of contacts where that help can be found.
javascript is in use as well to the main function of the site. SSL for site security so the visitors keep their contact details and story private, HTML and CSS for site functionality.</br>

            Hardware: computers</br><P></h7>

<h5> Project Skills Required</h5><h7>
Soft skills : a programmer needs to develop the site with code written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and javascript.
Site security is very important to protect the privacy of the women and their kids.
Mysql database to secure and store the details of visitors and the protection help providers.<P></h7>


<h5> Project Outcome </h5><h7>

The site will help to provide a safe, anonymous and trustworthy environment that allows women and children to comfortably gain direct access to essential facilities.
The  website will cover all aspects relating to the wellbeing of women and children, incorporating with the English language access to information in three languages.</br>
